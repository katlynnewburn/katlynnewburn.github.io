This respository contains a twine story, that is a choose your own adventure storyline that focuses on King Henry VIII, and some of his wvies as well as other possible wives. This interactive story allows the readers to role play as King Henry VIII, and to make choices that will affect the outcome of Henry's life choices that shaped his reign and the fates of his queens.
